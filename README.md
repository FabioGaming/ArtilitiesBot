# ArtilitiesBot
## The official Artilities Discord Bot

# What this bot does
This bot much like Artilitites itself is created to help people against Artblock and such, upon joining a server, the bot will send a greetings message into the servers welcome channel, or tries to directly message the owner of the server!

# Bot Commands
The bots prefix is `art!`
### List of commands
- `art!help` - Will display a help message about the bots commands
- `art!idea` - Will return an Art idea you could try drawing in both russian and english!
- `art!challenge` - Will return an Art challenge you could try out to challenge yourself a bit.
- `art!getchallenge` - much like `art!challenge`, this command will return an Art idea along with an Art challenge in both russian and english!
- `art!lookup <term>` - This command allows you to look up Artist Slang saved in the Artilitites Database!
- `art!user <@tag> / <DiscordID>` - This command allows you to see the saved ideas, challenges and colors of a user, note that this user needs to be registered into the Artilities Database

## Will this bot save any Information about any server?
**No**. This bot won't save any information about any server, the only things we do take a log of, are normal discord Log event messages.
